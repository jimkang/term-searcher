==================

Searches a [static-web-archive](jimkang/static-web-archive) using metadata from [archive-tfidf](https://github.com/jimkang/archive-tfidf).

Installation
------------

First, install Node and set up an .npmrc to point to the GitHub Package Registry. Then:

    npm install
    npm install wzrd -g

Usage
-----

    make run

Then, wzrd will say something like:

    wzrd index.js
    server started at http://localhost:9966

You can open your browser to that.

You can then add code starting in app.js. This won't compile down to ES 5 â€“ expects clients to support ES 6. You can check out an earlier commit of this repo - d227984628e258a2cf82fa14926b0e452fe4f5f9 or earlier - if you want support for that.

Run `make prettier` (expects you to have run `npm install -g prettier`) and `eslint .` before committing.
